# Updates

## 15/10/2023 - A wild new decoding project appears by abiogenesis

Today we began to port [vhs-decode](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode/) into C++. Rhowsl [(@rhowsl)](https://github.com/rhowsl) and I [(@Inky1003)](https://github.com/Inky1003) started the project that will hopefully make vhs-decoding faster!

As the time I'm writing this, the project is at a completely initial stage and the source is closed until It gets more mature.

## FAQ

**Who are you?** 🫵

[Inky and Rhowsl](#youyourdevice--uname--a--who-are-you), nice to meet ya xd

**Why are you porting?** 🤔

Because no one would like to wait an entire week to decode a single tape. Python is a good language for small projects and simple scripts, but It's perfomance is not suitable for longer projects, so we are porting it to a more low-level approach which will fast things up :)

**Why not X lang but C++?** 🦀

Some told me to port in Rust, but I'll not. We don't know Rust as well as we know C or C++. The same applies to other languages.

**Where is the code?** 👨‍💻

The project source code will not be available publicly until It's mature and at least sort of usable.

**Will you do X feature?** ✨

🤷

We can do If It's useful and not impossible to make. But don't keep asking for features before we haven't even open-sourced an usable source code!

**Will you also port ld-decode?** 📀

❌ 

No. I'm sorry, but neither of us has LaserDiscs on our homes. I'd really like If in our country LaserDiscs were common, but they're rare, even too expensive and unusual in the 80's. Also, our focus is in VHS, and as I write, only I (Inky) has a RF capture device currently.

**Will It be compatible with vhs-decode formats (Like JSON/TBC)?** 📼

✅

As we are porting, mainly yes. If we manage to change something in the spec or change to another better format, we'll post up there.

**Can I help with X?** 

🤷

If It's anything non-programming related, but still related directly with the project, thanks, but your help will be useful later on, not now. If It's programming related, [tell us!](#youyourdevice--uname--a--who-are-you)
