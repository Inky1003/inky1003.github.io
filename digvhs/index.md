# Updates

## 15/10/2023 - A wild new decoding project appears by abiogenesis

Today we began to port [vhs-decode](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode/) into C++. Rhowsl [(@rhowsl)](https://github.com/rhowsl) and I [(@Inky1003)](https://github.com/Inky1003) started the project that will hopefully make vhs-decoding faster!

As the time I'm writing this, the project is at a completely initial stage and the source is closed until It gets more mature.

## FAQ

**Who are you?** 🫵

[Inky and Rhowsl](#youyourdevice--uname--a--who-are-you), nice to meet ya xd

**Why are you porting?** 🤔

Because no one would like to wait an entire week to decode a single tape. Python is a good language for small projects and simple scripts, but It's perfomance is not suitable for longer projects, so we are porting it to a more low-level approach which will fast things up :)

**Why not X lang but C++?** 🦀

Some told me to port in Rust, but I'll not. We don't know Rust as well as we know C or C++. The same applies to other languages.

**Where is the code?** 👨‍💻

The project source code will not be available publicly until It's mature and at least sort of usable.

**Will you do X feature?** ✨

🤷

We can do If It's useful and not impossible to make. But don't keep asking for features before we haven't even open-sourced an usable source code!

**Will you also port ld-decode?** 📀

🤷 

Not really ld-decode, but a bit of It. vhs-decode requires some functions from ld-decode, so... We at any moment will port a bit of It, even though we won't port every ld-decode functionality.

**Will It be compatible with vhs-decode formats (Like JSON/TBC)?** 📼

✅

As we are porting, mainly yes. If we manage to change something in the spec or change to another better format, we'll post up there.

**Can I help with X?** 

🤷

If It's anything non-programming related, but still related directly with the project, thanks, but your help will be useful later on, not now. If It's programming related, [tell us!](#youyourdevice--uname--a--who-are-you)
