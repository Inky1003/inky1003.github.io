# Updates

## 16/11/2023 - Small steps xd

To celebrate a month of development, I'd like to thank Rhowsl for the hard work on DIGVHS. He ported most of the functions, as his knowledge in modern C++ is greater than mine, and his enthusiasm is big enough to make everything, even after a tiring work day at his job. Thanks Rhowsl!

Now the update: we got some filters to work, also needed to change some things about ld-decode. We definitely need to port lddecode, as many functions were got from It.

Also, something that got us were the Linear Algebra and Signal Processing functions, which we need to learn deeper about them.

So... that's It! I'll keep you informed when we get any better.

## 15/10/2023 - A wild new decoding project appears by abiogenesis

Today we began to port [vhs-decode](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode/) into C++. Rhowsl [(@rhowsl)](https://github.com/rhowsl) and I [(@Inky1003)](https://github.com/Inky1003) started the project that will hopefully make vhs-decoding faster!

As the time I'm writing this, the project is at a completely initial stage and the source is closed until It gets more mature.

## FAQ

**Who are you?** ü´µ

[Inky and Rhowsl](#youyourdevice--uname--a--who-are-you), nice to meet ya xd

**Why are you porting?** ü§î

Because no one would like to wait an entire week to decode a single tape. Python is a good language for small projects and simple scripts, but It's perfomance is not suitable for longer projects, so we are porting it to a more low-level approach which will fast things up :)

**Why not X lang but C++?** ü¶Ä

Some told me to port in Rust, but I'll not. We don't know Rust as well as we know C or C++. The same applies to other languages.

**Where is the code?** üë®‚Äçüíª

The project source code will not be available publicly until It's mature and at least sort of usable.

**Will you do X feature?** ‚ú®

ü§∑

We can do If It's useful and not impossible to make. But don't keep asking for features before we haven't even open-sourced an usable source code!

**Will you also port ld-decode?** üìÄ

ü§∑ 

Not really ld-decode, but a bit of It. vhs-decode requires some functions from ld-decode, so... We at any moment will port a bit of It, maybe not everything.

**Will It be compatible with vhs-decode formats (Like JSON/TBC)?** üìº

‚úÖ

As we are porting, mainly yes. If we manage to change something in the spec or change to another better format, we'll post up there.

**Can I help with X?** 

ü§∑

If It's anything non-programming related, but still related directly with the project, thanks, but your help will be useful later on, not now. If It's programming related, [tell us!](#youyourdevice--uname--a--who-are-you)
